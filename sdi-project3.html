<p>I kept the same story premice for this project.  Ive been doing ok with it so i figured i might as well stick with it.  I chose to do a story about prepping to go on a mountain bike ride on a trail.  its one of my hobbies and something i really enjoy.</p>
<p>While making this project it was smooth at times but was really challenging  most of the time.  So far i have learned a ton about javascript.</p>
